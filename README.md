### Project Description
The Procrastination Timer is an interactive alarm clock designed to prevent users from hitting the snooze button by requiring them to complete engaging tasks to silence the alarm. Combining creativity and fun, it offers various mental and physical challenges, ensuring a more stimulating wake-up experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The Procrastination Timer Alarm Clock humorously addresses the common and often ridiculous habit of hitting the snooze button and going back to sleep instead of starting the day. By incorporating interactive tasks and challenges that users must complete to turn off the alarm, it tackles the absurdity of our reluctance to get out of bed. The project embraces creativity and fascination, transforming a mundane routine into a playful engagement that highlights the lengths people go to avoid waking up‚Äîessentially turning the act of procrastination itself into a comical challenge.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Procrastination Timer Alarm Clock takes a fun and lighthearted approach to solving the snooze-button dilemma. Instead of simply sounding an alarm, it turns waking up into an entertaining game. Users are greeted with quirky tasks‚Äîlike solving a riddle, doing a quick dance, or even completing a silly challenge‚Äîthat must be tackled to silence the alarm. This playful interaction not only makes getting out of bed a bit more enjoyable but also sparks laughter and creativity, transforming the dreaded morning routine into a delightful adventure. By combining humor with a bit of a wake-up challenge, we're turning procrastination into a fun opportunity to kickstart the day!

(Add your workflow/architecture diagram here)
1. ESP32:
The ESP32 appears to be the main microcontroller, connected to various components.
It controls two ultrasonic sensors (labeled "ULT") for distance measurement or object detection.
2. L298 Motor Driver:
The ESP32 is connected to an L298 motor driver, which controls two motors (labeled "M1" and "M2").
This setup likely enables movement or rotation.
3. L298 Motor Driver:
The ESP32 is connected to an L298 motor driver, which controls two motors (labeled "M1" and "M2").
This setup likely enables movement or rotation.
4. Arduino Nano:
The Arduino Nano works with the ESP32, connected to a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module for timekeeping and an LCD for display.
Push buttons are connected with the arduino nano for the purpose of time setting.
5. MP3 Module and Speaker:
An MP3 module is linked to the ESP32, allowing audio output, which is played through the connected speaker. This is used for alarms and voice prompts.
6. Arduino Nano:
The Arduino Nano works with the ESP32, connected to a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module for timekeeping and an LCD for display.
Push buttons are connected with the arduino nano for the purpose of time setting.
7. ESP32 CAM:
The ESP32 CAM module is included for image or video capture, adding a visual element to the project for internal monitoring.
8. Additional ESP32 with PIO:
Another ESP32 unit is connected to a "PIO" and an additional ultrasonic sensor. The purpose of the PIO(Piezoelectric sensor is to detect the motion of human ie;whether he is awake or not
